# Chess

It will have as much functionality as can be achieved; I'll add castling, en passant, pawn promotions, and all that *jazz* :)

The program aims to be as self-explanatory as possible, but there **is** a help menu should you need it. It goes over how to play the game, and how the input works.

There will likely be bugs somewhere, so if you uncover any errors, **please** create an issue at https://github.com/cfop-user/Chess/issues
